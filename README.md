## ML 10701 Final Project

We performed model distillation on four foundational image classification models (RESNET-18, AlexNET, VGG16, EfficientNET) to analyze the impact of replacing select convolutional layers with linear layers. Our layer replacement experiments for each model are in .ipynb files within the labeled folders. Some models contain one .ipynb file per experiment, and others have included all experiments in a single .ipynb file.

EfficientNET has one .ipynb file with all outputs saved that is very large and one .pynb file without outputs which is easier to view.

The following files contianing final code are:
 - AlexNet_Final.ipynb
 - ML10701_EfficientNet_replace_without_outputs.ipynb (Outputs are in ML10701_EfficientNet_replace.ipynb)
 - VGG16_final.ipynb
 - All files in the RESNET folder

A subset of the ImageNet dataset (Imagenette, 160px) was used and can be downloaded from: https://github.com/fastai/imagenette.
